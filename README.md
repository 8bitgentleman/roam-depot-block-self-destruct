Set blocks to self-destruct (be deleted) after a period of time. When a roam graph is opened the plugin will search for all blocks that reference #[[self-destruct]] (configurable to whatever you would like). Any of those references that are older than the time set will be deleted.

A custom deletion time can be set by nesting an attribute below the block that you want deleted.

### Use Case
- Using queries on your Daily Notes page. Repetitive
- Blocks left over from daily templates 
- Keeping your graph lean and clean
